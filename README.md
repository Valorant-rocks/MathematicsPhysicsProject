# Mathematics Project

Welcome to the Mathematics Project, a C# console application that provides various mathematical functionalities. This application allows you to perform the following mathematical tasks:

1. **Factorial Calculation:**
   - Calculate the factorial of an integer.
   - Approximate the factorial of non-integer numbers using the gamma function.

2. **Quadratic Equation Solver:**
   - Solve quadratic equations in the form of Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0.
   - Provides real and complex solutions, if applicable.

3. **Linear Equation Solver:**
   - Solve systems of linear equations.
   - Enter the coefficients and constants to find the solution.

4. **Physics Problems:**
   - Calculate distance traveled and other physics-related numericals involving variable acceleration.
